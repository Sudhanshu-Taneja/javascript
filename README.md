# Javascript
1. JS is a synchronous single-threaded language. It means JS can execute one command at a time and in a specific order.
2. JS is a loosely typed language or weekly typed language because it is very flexible in variable defining.
3. JS can behave both an interpreted & compiled language depending on the JS engine.
4. If you mention, "use strict" on the top of your javascript file, it enables the strict mode which treats all JS code as newer version.
