# Promises

The promise object represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. A promise is in one of these states - 

1. Pending - Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. Fulfilled - Meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
3. Rejected - Meaning that the operation failed.
